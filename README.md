# GHO: Life Expectancy and Health Outcomes Dashboard

## Impact
This dashboard project focuses on a comprehensive view of global health, combining critical health metrics with socioeconomic factors to offer an understanding of public well-being. By correlating health data like disease prevalence and mortality rates with economic and educational indicators, these dashboards shed light on how varying conditions and policies impact health outcomes across different regions and demographics. This enables policymakers, healthcare professionals, and researchers to identify trends, disparities, and areas needing intervention. The insights gained from these dashboards can inform more effective health strategies, targeted resource allocation, and policy development.

## Dashboard Overview
The first dashboard, "Public Health and Disease Impact," visualizes the interplay between  diseases and overall health outcomes across different countries. By examining trends in life expectancy, mortality rates, and the prevalence of diseases like HIV/AIDS, it offers vital insights into the effectiveness of healthcare interventions and the urgent health challenges faced globally. 

The second dashboard, "Socioeconomic Factors and Health Outcomes," delves into the complex relationship between economic indicators, educational attainment, and health. It highlights how factors like GDP, healthcare expenditure, and education levels influence life expectancy and health quality, revealing disparities and guiding targeted policy interventions. Both dashboards serve as powerful tools for policymakers, health professionals, and researchers, aiding in data-driven decision-making to improve public health and well-being.

## Data Sources
The Global Health Organization (GHO) data repository from the World Health Organization (WHO) keeps track of health status, diseases, immunization rates, and other factors related to life expectancy. This dataset was sourced from 193 countries collected from the same WHO data repository and combines economic data collected from the United Nations (UN) website.

## Usage
**Dashboard 1: Public Health and Disease Impact**
**Overview:** This dashboard visualizes the relationship between diseases, health outcomes, and healthcare interventions across countries. It includes trends in life expectancy, mortality rates, and disease prevalence.

**Interacting with the Dashboard:**

**1. Filter by Country or Region:** Use the drop-down menus or map selection to filter the data for specific countries or regions.

**2. Time Range Selection:** A slider allows users to select the time range, updating all visualizations to reflect data from that period.

**3. Highlighting Data:** Clicking on a specific disease in one chart will highlight related data across other charts, enabling a focused view of that disease’s impact.

**4. Dynamic Sets:** Interact with charts to dynamically group countries based on criteria like high mortality rates, modifying the displayed data in response to selections.

**Dashboard 2: Socioeconomic Factors and Health Outcomes**
**Overview:** This dashboard correlates socioeconomic indicators with health outcomes, revealing how factors like GDP, education, and healthcare spending influence life expectancy.

**Interacting with the Dashboard:**

**1. Parameter Controls:** Adjust parameters to focus on particular health metrics, dynamically changing the data displayed in the visualizations.

**2. Country Selection for Detailed View:** Clicking on a country in any visualization brings up detailed data and charts related to that country’s socioeconomic status and health outcomes.

**3. Comparative Analysis:** Use set actions to compare groups of countries, such as developed versus developing nations, to understand differing health impacts.
